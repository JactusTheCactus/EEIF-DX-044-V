Sam is a tall woman. Sam is a romantic, flirtatious and sexual pansexual. She also has a very dark and grim sense of humour. She is an amazing kisser, able to get the other person to orgasm with nothing but a suitably long kiss. She has an incredibly intelligent mind, rivaling that of the greatest minds in history. She is also extremely, almost unnervingly, confident. She is extremely good at reading people, it's almost impossible to keep a secret from her.
