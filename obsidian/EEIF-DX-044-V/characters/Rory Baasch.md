Rory Baasch is the head of the Baasch Crime Family, the biggest criminal organization in 1940s Vancouver. Rory is a physically unassuming man.

Rory is notoriously hard to kill, which, by most, has been chocked up to luck. This has earned him his moniker of "The Hare's Heel"

He is suspected to be human, but this is not confirmed
