  Dollie is a Siren, a subspecies of Pred, meaning her gaze and her voice have the ability to hypnotize anyone to do her bidding. Dollie is quite sadistic, with complete apathy for anyone who hasn't accomplished the feat of befriending her. She loves to hypnotize her Prey prior to eating them. In fact, she is physically weak, so she has no hope of eating a struggling Prey, forcing her to hypnotize Prey beforehand. Dollie has never met a Prey that can resist her charms.
